The response period may be extended once by 45 additional days when reasonably necessary, taking into account the complexity and number of the consumer's requests, so long as the controller informs the consumer of any such extension within the initial 45-day response period, together with the reason for the extension.\n(c) If a controller declines to take action regarding the consumer's request, the controller shall inform the consumer without undue delay, but in all cases within 45 days of receipt of the request, of the justification for declining to take action and instructions for how to appeal the decision.\n(d) Information provided pursuant to this section shall be provided by a controller free of charge, up to twice annually per consumer. If requests from a consumer are manifestly unfounded, excessive, or repetitive, the controller may charge the consumer a reasonable fee to cover the administrative costs of complying with the request or decline to act on the request. The controller shall bear the burden of demonstrating the manifestly unfounded, excessive, or repetitive nature of the request.\n(e) A controller shall not be required to comply with a request from a consumer pursuant to this section if the controller is unable to authenticate the request using commercially reasonable efforts. In the event a controller is unable to authenticate a request, the controller may request the provision of additional information reasonably necessary to authenticate the consumer and the consumer's request.\n(f) A controller that has obtained personal data about a consumer from a source other than the consumer shall be deemed in compliance with a consumer's request to delete such data pursuant to subdivision (a)(3) by retaining a record of the deletion request and the minimum data necessary for the purpose of ensuring the consumer's personal data remains deleted from the controller's records and not using such retained data for any other purpose pursuant to this chapter; or by opting the consumer out of the processing of such personal data for any purpose except for those exempted pursuant to Section 59.1-582.\n(g) A controller shall establish a process for a consumer to appeal the controller's refusal to take action on a request within a reasonable period of time after the consumer's receipt of the decision pursuant to subsection (c). The appeal process shall be conspicuously available and similar to the process for submitting requests to initiate action pursuant to subsection (a). Within 60 days of receipt of an appeal, a controller shall inform the consumer in writing of any action taken or not taken in response to the appeal, including a written explanation of the reasons for the decisions. If the appeal is denied, the controller shall also provide the consumer with an online mechanism, if available, or other method through which the consumer may contact the Attorney General to submit a complaint.\nSection 59.1-577.1\nSocial Media Platforms; Minor Protections\n(a) A social media platform, as defined in Section 59.1-575, shall use commercially reasonable methods, such as a neutral age screen mechanism that is designed to accurately verify a user's age, to determine whether a user of the platform is a minor. If a user of the platform is determined to be a minor, the social media platform shall limit the user to no more than one hour of use per day, per social media platform, service, or application.\n(b) A social media platform shall not use any age-determination data for a purpose other than verifying the user's age.\n(c) A social media platform shall not degrade the quality of a product or service used by a minor or increase the price of a product or service used by a minor to enforce the daily time limit set forth in subsection (a).\n(d) A parent may grant consent to modify the daily time limits established pursuant to subsection (a)."

However, nothing in this subdivision shall be construed to require a controller to provide a product or service that requires the personal data of a consumer that the controller does not collect or maintain, or to prohibit a controller from offering a different price, rate, level, quality, or selection of goods or services to a consumer, including offering goods or services for no fee, if the consumer has exercised the right to opt out pursuant to subdivision (a)(5) of Section 59.1-577 or the offer is related to a consumer's voluntary participation in a bona fide loyalty, rewards, premium features, discounts, or club card program; and\n(6) Not process sensitive data concerning a consumer without obtaining the consumer's consent, or, in the case of the processing of sensitive data concerning a known child, without processing such data in accordance with the federal Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (15 U.S.C. Section 6501 et seq.).\n(b) A controller shall provide consumers with a reasonably accessible, clear, and meaningful privacy notice that includes:\n(1) The categories of personal data processed by the controller;\n(2) The purpose for processing personal data;\n(3) How consumers may exercise their consumer rights pursuant to Section 59.1-577, including how a consumer may appeal a controller's decision with regard to the consumer's request;\n(4) The categories of personal data that the controller shares with third parties, if any; and\n(5) The categories of third parties, if any, with whom the controller shares personal data.\n(c) If a controller sells personal data to third parties or processes personal data for targeted advertising, the controller shall clearly and conspicuously disclose such processing, as well as the manner in which a consumer may exercise the right to opt out of such processing, in a clear and conspicuous manner.\n(d) A controller shall not process the personal data of a known child for purposes of targeted advertising, the sale of such personal data, or profiling in furtherance of decisions that produce legal or similarly significant effects concerning such known child, unless the processing is reasonably necessary to provide a product or service specifically requested by a known child or the parent of such known child and with the consent of the known child's parent consistent with the federal Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (15 U.S.C.

Such assistance shall include:\n(1) Taking into account the nature of processing and the information available to the processor, by appropriate technical and organizational measures, insofar as this is reasonably practicable, to fulfill the controller's obligation to respond to consumer rights requests pursuant to Section 59.1-577;\n(2) Taking into account the nature of processing and the information available to the processor, by assisting the controller in meeting the controller's obligations in relation to the security of processing the personal data and in relation to the notification of a breach of security of the system of the processor, pursuant to Section 18.2-186.6, and any similar provision as may be enacted, to the extent applicable to the personal data processed for the controller;\n(3) Providing necessary information to enable the controller to conduct and document any data protection assessments required by Section 59.1-580; and\n(4) By contract, require that any subcontractor engaged by the processor meets the obligations of the processor with respect to the personal data.\n(b) A contract between a controller and a processor shall govern the processor's data processing procedures with respect to processing performed on behalf of the controller. The contract shall be binding and clearly set forth instructions for processing data, the nature and purpose of processing, the type of data subject to processing, the duration of processing, and the rights and obligations of both parties. The contract shall also include requirements that the processor shall:\n(1) Ensure that each person processing personal data is subject to a duty of confidentiality with respect to the data;\n(2) At the controller's direction, delete or return all personal data to the controller as requested at the end of the provision of services, unless retention of the personal data is required by law;\n(3) Upon the reasonable request of the controller, make available to the controller all information in its possession necessary to demonstrate the processor's compliance with the obligations in this chapter;\n(4) Allow and reasonably cooperate with reasonable assessments by the controller or the controller's designated assessor. Alternatively, the processor may arrange for a qualified and independent assessor to conduct an assessment of the processor's policies and technical and organizational measures in support of the obligations under this chapter using an appropriate and accepted control standard or framework and assessment procedure for such assessments. The processor shall provide a report of such assessment to the controller upon request; and\n(5) Engage any subcontractor pursuant to a written contract in accordance with subsection (a) that requires the subcontractor to meet the obligations of the processor with respect to the personal data.\n(c) Nothing in this section shall be construed to relieve a controller or a processor from the liabilities imposed on it by virtue of its role in the processing relationship as determined by this chapter.\n(d) Determining whether a person is acting as a controller or processor with respect to a specific processing of data is a fact-based determination that depends upon the context in which personal data is to be processed. A person that is not limited in its processing of personal data pursuant to a controller's instructions, or that fails to adhere to such instructions, is a controller and not a processor with respect to a specific processing of data. A processor that continues to adhere to a controller's instructions with respect to a specific processing of personal data remains a processor. If a processor begins, alone or jointly with others, to determine the purposes and means of the processing of personal data, the processor is a controller with respect to such processing."

Such assessment shall address the purpose of the online service, product, or feature; how personal data may be used by the online service, product, or feature; and the risks of material detriment to children that arise from the data management practices of the controller.\n(c) Data protection assessments conducted pursuant to subsection (a) or (b) shall identify and weigh the benefits that may flow, directly and indirectly, from the processing to the controller, to the consumer, to other stakeholders, and to the public against the potential risks to the rights of the consumer associated with such processing, as mitigated by safeguards that can be employed by the controller to reduce such risks. The use of de-identified data and the reasonable expectations of consumers, as well as the context of the processing and the relationship between the controller and the consumer whose personal data will be processed, shall be factored into the assessment by the controller.\n(d) The Attorney General may require that a controller disclose any data protection assessment that is relevant to an investigation conducted by the Attorney General pursuant to this chapter and the controller shall make the data protection assessment available to the Attorney General upon such request. The Attorney General may evaluate the data protection assessment for compliance with the responsibilities set forth in Section 59.1-578 and Section 59.1-579. Data protection assessments shall be confidential and shall be exempt from public inspection and copying under the Virginia Freedom of Information Act (Section 2.2-3700 et seq.). To the extent any information contained in a data protection assessment disclosed to the Attorney General includes information subject to attorney-client privilege or work product protection, such disclosure shall not constitute a waiver of such privilege or protection.\n(e) A single data protection assessment may address a comparable set of processing operations that include similar activities.\n(f) Data protection assessments conducted by a controller for the purpose of compliance with other laws or regulations may qualify as a data protection assessment for purposes of this section if the assessment has a reasonably comparable scope and effect."

            "text": "(a) Nothing in this chapter shall be construed to restrict a controller's or processor's ability to:\n(1) Comply with federal, state, or local laws, rules, or regulations;\n(2) Comply with a civil, criminal, or regulatory inquiry, investigation, subpoena, or summons by federal, state, local, or other governmental authorities;\n(3) Cooperate with law enforcement agencies concerning conduct or activity that the controller or processor reasonably and in good faith believes may violate federal, state, or local laws, rules, or regulations;\n(4) Investigate, establish, exercise, prepare for, or defend legal claims;\n(5) Provide a product or service specifically requested by a consumer or a parent of a child, perform a contract to which the consumer is a party, including fulfilling the terms of a written warranty, or take steps at the request of the consumer prior to entering into a contract;\n(6) Take immediate steps to protect an interest that is essential for the life or physical safety of the consumer or of another natural person, and where the processing cannot be manifestly based on another legal basis;\n(7) Prevent, detect, protect against, or respond to security incidents, identity theft, fraud, harassment, malicious or deceptive activities, or any illegal activity; preserve the integrity or security of systems; or investigate, report, or prosecute those responsible for any such action;\n(8) Engage in public or peer-reviewed scientific or statistical research in the public interest that adheres to all other applicable ethics and privacy laws and is approved, monitored, and governed by an institutional review board, or similar independent oversight entities that determine that the controller has implemented reasonable safeguards to mitigate privacy risks associated with research, including any risks associated with re-identification; or\n(9) Assist another controller, processor, or third party with any of the obligations under this subsection.\n(b) The obligations imposed on controllers or processors under this chapter shall not restrict a controller's or processor's ability to collect, use, or retain data to:\n(1) Conduct internal research to develop, improve, or repair products, services, or technology;\n(2) Effectuate a product recall;\n(3) Identify and repair technical errors that impair existing or intended functionality; or\n(4) Perform internal operations that are reasonably aligned with the expectations of the consumer or reasonably anticipated based on the consumer's existing relationship with the controller, or are otherwise compatible with processing data in furtherance of the provision of a product or service specifically requested by a consumer or a parent of a child or the performance of a contract to which the consumer is a party.\n(c) The obligations imposed on controllers or processors under this chapter shall not apply where compliance by the controller or processor with this chapter would violate an evidentiary privilege under the laws of the Commonwealth. Nothing in this chapter shall be construed to prevent a controller or processor from providing personal data concerning a consumer to a person covered by an evidentiary privilege under the laws of the Commonwealth as part of a privileged communication.\n(d) A controller or processor that discloses personal data to a third-party controller or processor in compliance with the requirements of this chapter shall not be deemed to have violated this chapter if the recipient processes such personal data in violation of this chapter, provided that, at the time of disclosing the personal data, the disclosing controller or processor did not have actual knowledge that the recipient intended to commit a violation. A third-party controller or processor receiving personal data from a controller or processor in compliance with this chapter is likewise not in violation of this chapter for the transgressions of the controller or processor from which the third-party controller or processor received such personal data."

If, within 30 days of receipt of the notice of violation, the controller or processor cures the noticed violation and provides the Attorney General an express written statement that the alleged violations have been cured and that no further violations shall occur, no action shall be initiated against the controller or processor. Violations that occur after a cure has been effected under this subsection shall be subject to the full enforcement authority of the Attorney General without the opportunity to cure.\n(c) If the controller or processor continues to violate this chapter following the cure period provided in subsection (b), the Attorney General may initiate an action in the name of the Commonwealth and may seek an injunction to restrain any violations of this chapter and civil penalties of up to $7,500 for each violation.\n(d) All attorney fees, expenses, and costs reasonably expended by the Attorney General in investigating and preparing a violation of this chapter shall be recovered by the Attorney General.
