RULE I 
THE SPEAKER 
Approval of the Journal 
1. The Speaker shall take the Chair 
on every legislative day precisely at 
the hour to which the House last ad-
journed and immediately call the 
House to order. Having examined and 
approved the Journal of the last day’s 
proceedings, the Speaker shall an-
nounce to the House approval thereof. 
The Speaker’s approval of the Journal 
shall be deemed agreed to unless a 
Member, Delegate, or Resident Com-
missioner demands a vote thereon. If 
such a vote is decided in the affirma-
tive, it shall not be subject to a motion 
to reconsider. If such a vote is decided 
in the negative, then one motion that 
the Journal be read shall be privileged, 
shall be decided without debate, and 
shall not be subject to a motion to re-
consider. 
Preservation of order 
2. The Speaker shall preserve order 
and decorum and, in case of disturb-
ance or disorderly conduct in the gal-
leries or in the lobby, may cause the 
same to be cleared. 
Control of Capitol facilities 
3. Except as otherwise provided by 
rule or law, the Speaker shall have 
general control of the Hall of the

use of the House, and the disposal of 
unappropriated rooms in that part of 
the Capitol. 
Signature of documents 
4. The Speaker shall sign all acts and 
joint resolutions passed by the two 
Houses and all writs, warrants, and 
subpoenas of, or issued by order of, the 
House. The Speaker may sign enrolled 
bills and joint resolutions whether or 
not the House is in session. 
Questions of order 
5. The Speaker shall decide all ques-
tions of order, subject to appeal by a 
Member, Delegate, or Resident Com-
missioner. On such an appeal a Mem-
ber, Delegate, or Resident Commis-
sioner may not speak more than once 
without permission of the House. 
Form of a question 
6. The Speaker shall put a question 
in this form: ‘‘Those in favor (of the 
question), say ‘Aye.’ ’’; and after the af-
firmative voice is expressed, ‘‘Those 
opposed, say ‘No.’ ’’. After a vote by 
voice under this clause, the Speaker 
may use such voting procedures as may 
be invoked under rule XX.

may exercise such authorities of the 
Office of Speaker as may be necessary 
and appropriate to that end. 
(B) As soon as practicable after the 
election of the Speaker and whenever 
appropriate thereafter, the Speaker 
shall deliver to the Clerk a list of 
Members in the order in which each 
shall act as Speaker pro tempore under 
subdivision (A).

5. (a)(1) The standing committees 
specified in clause 1 shall be elected by 
the House within seven calendar days 
after the commencement of each Con-
gress, from nominations submitted by

pose any service for less than a full ses-
sion in a Congress). 
(C) A member of the Committee on 
Ethics may serve on the committee 
during a fourth or fifth Congress in a

under paragraph (a)(4) does not count 
against the limitation on sub-
committee service. 
(iii) Any other exception to the limi-
tations in subdivision (A) may be ap-
proved by the House on the rec-
ommendation of the relevant party 
caucus or conference.

subject to and until enactment of the 
provisions of the resolution as per-

(d) From the funds made available 
for the appointment of committee staff 
by a primary or additional expense res-
olution, the chair of each committee

and paragraph (f), each standing com-
mittee may appoint, by majority vote, 
not more than 30 professional staff 
members to be compensated from the 
funds provided for the appointment of 
committee staff by primary and addi-
tional expense resolutions. Each pro-
fessional staff member appointed under 
this subparagraph shall be assigned to 
the chair and the ranking minority 
member of the committee, as the com-
mittee considers advisable. 
(2) Subject to paragraph (f) whenever 
a majority of the minority party mem-
bers of a standing committee (other 
than the Committee on Ethics or the 
Permanent Select Committee on Intel-
ligence) so request, not more than 10 
persons (or one-third of the total pro-
fessional committee staff appointed 
under this clause, whichever is fewer) 
may be selected, by majority vote of 
the minority party members, for ap-
pointment by the committee as profes-
sional staff members under subpara-
graph (1). The committee shall appoint 
persons so selected whose character 
and qualifications are acceptable to a 
majority of the committee. If the com-
mittee determines that the character 
and qualifications of a person so se-
lected are unacceptable, a majority of 
the minority party members may se-
lect another person for appointment by 
the committee to the professional staff 
until such appointment is made. Each 
professional staff member appointed 
under this subparagraph shall be as-
signed to such committee business as 
the minority party members of the 
committee consider advisable. 
(b)(1) The professional staff members 
of each standing committee— 
(A) may not engage in any work 
other than committee business dur-
ing congressional working hours; and 
(B) may not be assigned a duty 
other than one pertaining to com-
mittee business. 
(2)(A) Subparagraph (1) does not 
apply to staff designated by a com-
mittee as ‘‘associate’’ or ‘‘shared’’ staff 
who are not paid exclusively by the 
committee, provided that the chair 
certifies that the compensation paid by 
the committee for any such staff is 
commensurate with the work per-
formed for the committee in accord-
ance with clause 8 of rule XXIII. 
(B) The use of any ‘‘associate’’ or 
‘‘shared’’ staff by a committee other 
than the Committee on Appropriations 
shall be subject to the review of, and to 
any terms, conditions, or limitations 
established by, the Committee on 
House Administration in connection 
with the reporting of any primary or 
additional expense resolution. 
(c) Each employee on the profes-
sional or investigative staff of a stand-
ing committee shall be entitled to pay 
at a single gross per annum rate, to be 
fixed by the chair and that does not ex-
ceed the maximum rate of pay as in ef-
fect from time to time under applicable 
provisions of law. 
(d) Subject to appropriations hereby 
authorized, the Committee on Appro-
priations may appoint by majority 
vote such staff as it determines to be 
necessary (in addition to the clerk of 
the committee and assistants for the 
minority). The staff appointed under 
this paragraph, other than minority as-
sistants, shall possess such qualifica-
tions as the committee may prescribe. 
(e) A committee may not appoint to 
its staff an expert or other personnel 
detailed or assigned from a department 
or agency of the Government except 
with the written permission of the 
Committee on House Administration. 
(f) If a request for the appointment of 
a minority professional staff member 
under paragraph (a) is made when no 
vacancy exists for such an appoint-
ment, the committee nevertheless may 
appoint under paragraph (a) a person 
selected by the minority and accept-
able to the committee. A person so ap-
pointed shall serve as an additional 
member of the professional staff of the 
committee until such a vacancy occurs 
(other than a vacancy in the position 
of head of the professional staff, by 
whatever title designated), at which 
time that person is considered as ap-
pointed to that vacancy. Such a person 
shall be paid from the applicable ac-
counts of the House described in clause 
1(k)(1) of rule X. If such a vacancy oc-
curs on the professional staff when 
seven or more persons have been so ap-
pointed who are eligible to fill that va-
cancy, a majority of the minority 
party members shall designate which 
of those persons shall fill the vacancy. 
(g) Each staff member appointed pur-
suant to a request by minority party 
members under paragraph (a), and each 
staff member appointed to assist mi-
nority members of a committee pursu-
ant to an expense resolution described 
in clause 6(a), shall be accorded equi-
table treatment with respect to the fix-
ing of the rate of pay, the assignment 
of work facilities, and the accessibility 
of committee records. 
(h) Paragraph (a) may not be con-
strued to authorize the appointment of 
additional professional staff members 
of a committee pursuant to a request 
under paragraph (a) by the minority 
party members of that committee if 10 
or more professional staff members 
provided for in paragraph (a)(1) who are 
satisfactory to a majority of the mi-
nority party members are otherwise as-
signed to assist the minority party 
members. 
(i) Notwithstanding paragraph (a)(2), 
a committee may employ nonpartisan 
staff, in lieu of or in addition to com-
mittee staff designated exclusively for

matter otherwise within the jurisdic-
tion of a standing committee shall be 
referred by the Speaker to that stand-

initially reported by another com-
mittee that contains matter within the

(3) Nothing in this clause shall be 
construed as prohibiting or otherwise 
restricting the authority of any other 
committee to study and review an in-
telligence or intelligence-related activ-
ity to the extent that such activity di-
rectly affects a matter otherwise with-
in the jurisdiction of that committee. 
(4) Nothing in this clause shall be 
construed as amending, limiting, or 
otherwise changing the authority of a 
standing committee to obtain full and 
prompt access to the product of the in-
telligence and intelligence-related ac-

the Government relevant to a matter 
otherwise within the jurisdiction of 
that committee. 
(c)(1) For purposes of accountability 
to the House, the select committee 
shall make regular and periodic reports 
to the House on the nature and extent 
of the intelligence and intelligence-re-
lated activities of the various depart-
ments and agencies of the United 
States. The select committee shall 
promptly call to the attention of the 
House, or to any other appropriate 
committee, a matter requiring the at-
tention of the House or another com-
mittee. In making such report, the se-
lect committee shall proceed in a man-
ner consistent with paragraph (g) to 
protect national security. 
(2) The select committee shall obtain 
annual reports from the Director of Na-
tional Intelligence, the Director of the

shall review the intelligence and intel-
ligence-related activities of the agency 
or department concerned and the intel-
ligence and intelligence-related activi-
ties of foreign countries directed at the 
United States or its interests. An un-
classified version of each report may be 
made available to the public at the dis-
cretion of the select committee. Noth-
ing herein shall be construed as requir-
ing the public disclosure in such re-
ports of the names of persons engaged 
in intelligence or intelligence-related 
activities for the United States or the 
divulging of intelligence methods em-
ployed or the sources of information on 
which the reports are based or the 
amount of funds authorized to be ap-
propriated for intelligence and intel-
ligence-related activities. 
(3) Within six weeks after the Presi-
dent submits a budget under section 
1105(a) of title 31, United States Code,

committee shall submit to the Com-
mittee on the Budget the views and es-
timates described in section 301(d) of 
the Congressional Budget Act of 1974

tion of the select committee. 
(d)(1) Except as specified in subpara-
graph (2), clauses 8(a), (b), and (c) and 
9(a), (b), and (c) of this rule, and 
clauses 1, 2, and 4 of rule XI shall apply 
to the select committee to the extent 
not inconsistent with this clause. 
(2) Notwithstanding the requirements 
of the first sentence of clause 2(g)(2) of 
rule XI, in the presence of the number 
of members required under the rules of 
the select committee for the purpose of 
taking testimony or receiving evi-
dence, the select committee may vote 
to close a hearing whenever a majority 
of those present determines that the 
testimony or evidence would endanger 
the national security. 
(e) An employee of the select com-
mittee, or a person engaged by con-
tract or otherwise to perform services 
for or at the request of the select com-
mittee, may not be given access to any 
classified information by the select 
committee unless such employee or 
person has— 
(1) agreed in writing and under 
oath to be bound by the Rules of the 
House, including the jurisdiction of 
the Committee on Ethics and of the 
select committee concerning the se-
curity of classified information dur-
ing and after the period of the em-
ployment or contractual agreement 
of such employee or person with the 
select committee; and 
(2) received an appropriate security 
clearance, as determined by the se-
lect committee in consultation with 
the Director of National Intelligence, 
that is commensurate with the sensi-
tivity of the classified information to 
which such employee or person will 
be given access by the select com-
mittee. 
(f) The select committee shall formu-
late and carry out such rules and pro-
cedures as it considers necessary to 
prevent the disclosure, without the 
consent of each person concerned, of 
information in the possession of the se-
lect committee that unduly infringes 
on the privacy or that violates the con-
stitutional rights of such person. Noth-
ing herein shall be construed to pre-
vent the select committee from pub-
licly disclosing classified information 
in a case in which it determines that 
national interest in the disclosure of 
classified information clearly out-
weighs any infringement on the pri-
vacy of a person. 
(g)(1) The select committee may dis-
close publicly any information in its 
possession after a determination by the 
select committee that the public inter-
est would be served by such disclosure. 
With respect to the disclosure of infor-
mation for which this paragraph re-
quires action by the select com-
mittee— 
(A) the select committee shall 
meet to vote on the matter within 
five days after a member of the select 
committee requests a vote; and 
(B) a member of the select com-
mittee may not make such a disclo-
sure before a vote by the select com-
mittee on the matter, or after a vote 
by the select committee on the mat-
ter except in accordance with this 
paragraph.

RULES OF THE
16 
Rule X, clause 11 Rule X, clause 11 
(2)(A) In a case in which the select 
committee votes to disclose publicly 
any information that has been classi-
fied under established security proce-
dures, that has been submitted to it by 
the executive branch, and that the ex-
ecutive branch requests be kept secret, 
the select committee shall notify the 
President of such vote. 
(B) The select committee may dis-
close publicly such information after 
the expiration of a five-day period fol-
lowing the day on which notice of the 
vote to disclose is transmitted to the 
President unless, before the expiration 
of the five-day period, the President, 
personally in writing, notifies the se-
lect committee that the President ob-
jects to the disclosure of such informa-
tion, provides reasons therefor, and 
certifies that the threat to the na-
tional interest of the United States 
posed by the disclosure is of such grav-
ity that it outweighs any public inter-
est in the disclosure. 
(C) If the President, personally in 
writing, notifies the select committee 
of objections to the disclosure of infor-
mation as provided in subdivision (B), 
the select committee may, by majority 
vote, refer the question of the disclo-
sure of such information, with a rec-
ommendation thereon, to the House. 
The select committee may not publicly 
disclose such information without 
leave of the House. 
(D) Whenever the select committee 
votes to refer the question of disclosure 
of any information to the House under 
subdivision (C), the chair shall, not 
later than the first day on which the 
House is in session following the day 
on which the vote occurs, report the 
matter to the House for its consider-
ation. 
(E) If the chair of the select com-
mittee does not offer in the House a 
motion to consider in closed session a 
matter reported under subdivision (D) 
within four calendar days on which the 
House is in session after the rec-
ommendation described in subdivision 
(C) is reported, then such a motion 
shall be privileged when offered by a 
Member, Delegate, or Resident Com-
missioner. In either case such a motion 
shall be decided without debate or in-
tervening motion except one that the 
House adjourn. 
(F) Upon adoption by the House of a 
motion to resolve into closed session as 
described in subdivision (E), the Speak-
er may declare a recess subject to the 
call of the Chair. At the expiration of 
the recess, the pending question, in 
closed session, shall be, ‘‘Shall the 
House approve the recommendation of 
the select committee?’’. 
(G) Debate on the question described 
in subdivision (F) shall be limited to 
two hours equally divided and con-
trolled by the chair and ranking minor-
ity member of the select committee. 
After such debate the previous ques-
tion shall be considered as ordered on 
the question of approving the rec-
ommendation without intervening mo-
tion except one motion that the House 
adjourn. The House shall vote on the 
question in open session but without 
divulging the information with respect 
to which the vote is taken. If the rec-
ommendation of the select committee 
is not approved, then the question is 
considered as recommitted to the se-
lect committee for further rec-
ommendation. 
(3)(A) Information in the possession 
of the select committee relating to the 
lawful intelligence or intelligence-re-
lated activities of a department or 
agency of the United States that has 
been classified under established secu-
rity procedures, and that the select 
committee has determined should not 
be disclosed under subparagraph (1) or 
(2), may not be made available to any 
person by a Member, Delegate, Resi-
dent Commissioner, officer, or em-
ployee of the House except as provided 
in subdivision (B). 
(B) The select committee shall, under 
such regulations as it may prescribe, 
make information described in subdivi-
sion (A) available to a committee or a 
Member, Delegate, or Resident Com-
missioner, and permit a Member, Dele-
gate, or Resident Commissioner to at-
tend a hearing of the select committee 
that is closed to the public. Whenever 
the select committee makes such infor-
mation available, it shall keep a writ-
ten record showing, in the case of par-
ticular information, which committee 
or which Member, Delegate, or Resi-
dent Commissioner received the infor-
mation. A Member, Delegate, or Resi-
dent Commissioner who, and a com-
mittee that, receives information 
under this subdivision may not disclose 
the information except in a closed ses-
sion of the House. 
(4) The Committee on Ethics shall in-
vestigate any unauthorized disclosure 
of intelligence or intelligence-related

ployee of the House in violation of sub-
paragraph (3) and report to the House 
concerning any allegation that it finds 
to be substantiated. 
(5) Upon the request of a person who 
is subject to an investigation described 
in subparagraph (4), the Committee on 
Ethics shall release to such person at 
the conclusion of its investigation a 
summary of its investigation, together 
with its findings. If, at the conclusion 
of its investigation, the Committee on 
Ethics determines that there has been 
a significant breach of confidentiality 
or unauthorized disclosure by a Mem-
ber, Delegate, Resident Commissioner, 
officer, or employee of the House, it 
shall report its findings to the House 
and recommend appropriate action. 
Recommendations may include cen-
sure, removal from committee mem-
bership, or expulsion from the House, 
in the case of a Member, or removal 
from office or employment or punish-
ment for contempt, in the case of an of-
ficer or employee.

dent, designated by the President to

mittee, to attend any closed meeting of 
the select committee.

cal year, with the exception of a bill or 
joint resolution continuing appropria-
tions, or an amendment thereto, or a 
conference report thereon, to, or for 
use of, a department or agency of the 
United States to carry out any of the

(A) the collection, analysis, produc-
tion, dissemination, or use of infor-
mation that relates to a foreign

and still photography coverage, except 
when the committee or subcommittee, 
in open session and with a majority 
present, determines by record vote that 
all or part of the remainder of the 
meeting on that day shall be in execu-
tive session because disclosure of mat-
ters to be considered would endanger 
national security, would compromise 
sensitive law enforcement information, 
would tend to defame, degrade, or in-
criminate any person, or otherwise 
would violate a law or rule of the 
House. Persons, other than members of 
the committee and such noncommittee 
Members, Delegates, Resident Commis-

committee or subcommittee (other 
than the Committee on Ethics or its 
subcommittees) shall be open to the 
public, including to radio, television, 
and still photography coverage, except 
when the committee or subcommittee, 
in open session and with a majority 
present, determines by record vote that 
all or part of the remainder of that 
hearing on that day shall be closed to 
the public because disclosure of testi-
mony, evidence, or other matters to be 
considered would endanger national se-
curity, would compromise sensitive law 
enforcement information, or would vio-
late a law or rule of the House. 
(B) Notwithstanding the require-
ments of subdivision (A), in the pres-
ence of the number of members re-
quired under the rules of the com-
mittee for the purpose of taking testi-
mony, a majority of those present 
may— 
(i) agree to close the hearing for 
the sole purpose of discussing wheth-
er testimony or evidence to be re-
ceived would endanger national secu-
rity, would compromise sensitive law 
enforcement information, or would 
violate clause 2(k)(5); or 
(ii) agree to close the hearing as 
provided in clause 2(k)(5).

Commissioner may not be excluded 
from nonparticipatory attendance at a

a particular committee or sub-
committee, for purposes of a particular 
series of hearings on a particular arti-

secutive days of hearings.

cept when the House is in session on 
such a day) on which members have

(B) A hearing or meeting may begin 
sooner than specified in subdivision (A)

cumstances (in which case the chair 
shall make the announcement specified 
in subdivision (A) at the earliest pos-
sible time):

(C) upon receipt of a report regard-
ing a referral from the board of the 
Office of Congressional Ethics. 
If a complaint is not disposed of within 
the applicable periods set forth in the 
rules of the Committee on Ethics, the 
chair and ranking minority member 
shall establish jointly an investigative 
subcommittee and forward the com-
plaint, or any portion thereof, to that 
subcommittee for its consideration. 
However, if at any time during those 
periods either the chair or ranking mi-
nority member places on the agenda 
the issue of whether to establish an in-
vestigative subcommittee, then an in-
vestigative subcommittee may be es-
tablished only by an affirmative vote 
of a majority of the members of the 
committee. 
(3) The committee may not under-
take an investigation of an alleged vio-
lation of a law, rule, regulation, or 
standard of conduct that was not in ef- 
fect at the time of the alleged viola-
tion. The committee may not under-
take an investigation of such an al-
leged violation that occurred before 
the third previous Congress unless the 
committee determines that the alleged 
violation is directly related to an al-
leged violation that occurred in a more 
recent Congress. 
(4) A member of the committee shall 
be ineligible to participate as a mem-
ber of the committee in a committee 
proceeding relating to the member’s of-
ficial conduct. Whenever a member of 
the committee is ineligible to act as a 
member of the committee under the 
preceding sentence, the Speaker shall 
designate a Member, Delegate, or Resi-
dent Commissioner from the same po-
litical party as the ineligible member 
to act in any proceeding of the com-
mittee relating to that conduct. 
(5) A member of the committee may 
seek disqualification from partici-
pating in an investigation of the con-
duct of a Member, Delegate, Resident 
Commissioner, officer, or employee of 
the House upon the submission in writ-
ing and under oath of an affidavit of 
disqualification stating that the mem-
ber cannot render an impartial and un-
biased decision in the case in which the 
member seeks to be disqualified. If the 
committee approves and accepts such 
affidavit of disqualification, the chair 
shall so notify the Speaker and request 
the Speaker to designate a Member, 
Delegate, or Resident Commissioner 
from the same political party as the 
disqualifying member to act in any 
proceeding of the committee relating 
to that case. 
(6) Information or testimony re-
ceived, or the contents of a complaint 
or the fact of its filing, may not be 
publicly disclosed by any committee or 
staff member unless specifically au-
thorized in each instance by a vote of 
the full committee. 
(7) The committee shall have the 
functions designated in titles I and V 
of the Ethics in Government Act of 
1978, in sections 7342, 7351, and 7353 of 
title 5, United States Code, and in 
clause 11(g)(4) of rule X. 
(8)(A) Except as provided by subdivi-
sions (B), (C), and (D), not later than 45 
calendar days or 5 legislative days, 
whichever is later, after receipt of a 
written report and any findings and 
supporting documentation regarding a 
referral from the board of the Office of 
Congressional Ethics or of a referral of 
the matter from the board pursuant to 
a request under paragraph (r), the chair 
of the Committee on Ethics shall make 
public the written report and findings 
of the board unless the chair and rank-
ing member, acting jointly, decide or 
the committee votes to withhold such 
information for not more than one ad-
ditional period of the same duration, in 
which case the chair shall— 
(i) upon the termination of such ad-
ditional period, make public the 
written report and findings; and 
(ii) upon the day of such decision or 
vote, make a public statement that 
the matter, relating to the referral 
made by the board of the Office of 
Congressional Ethics regarding the 
Member, Delegate, Resident Commis-
sioner, officer, or employee of the 
House who is the subject of the appli-
cable referral, has been extended. 
At least one calendar day before the 
committee makes public any written 
report and findings of the board, the 
chair shall notify such board and the 
applicable Member, Delegate, Resident 
Commissioner, officer, or employee of 
that fact and transmit to such indi-
vidual a copy of the statement on the 
committee’s disposition of, and any 
committee report on, the matter. 
(B)(i) Notwithstanding subdivision 
(A)(i), if the committee votes to dis-
miss a matter which is the subject of a 
referral from the board of the Office of 
Congressional Ethics, the committee is 
not required to make public the writ-
ten report and findings described in 
such subdivision unless the commit-
tee’s vote is inconsistent with the rec-
ommendation of the board. For pur-
poses of the previous sentence, a vote 
by the committee to dismiss a matter 
is not inconsistent with a report from 
the board respecting the matter as un-
resolved due to a tie vote. 
(ii) Notwithstanding subdivision 
(A)(ii), if the board transmits a report 
respecting any matter with a rec-
ommendation to dismiss or as unre-
solved due to a tie vote, and the the 
matter is extended for an additional 
period as provided in subdivision (A), 
the committee is not required to make 
a public statement that the matter has 
been extended. 
(iii) Except as provided by subdivi-
sion (E), if the committee establishes 
an investigative subcommittee respect-
ing any such matter, then the report 
and findings of the board shall not be 
made public until the conclusion of the 
investigative subcommittee process 
and the committee shall issue a public 
statement of the establishment of an 
investigative subcommittee, which 
statement shall include the name of 
the applicable Member, Delegate, Resi-
dent Commissioner, officer, or em-
ployee, and shall set forth the alleged 
violation. If any such investigative 
subcommittee does not conclude its re-
view within one year after the board 
transmits a report respecting any mat-
ter, then the committee shall make 
public the report and upon the expira-
tion of the Congress in which the re-

mittee agrees to a request from an ap-
propriate law enforcement or regu-
latory authority to defer taking action 
on the matter— 
(I) notwithstanding subdivision 
(A)(i), the committee is not required

mittee shall make a new public state-
ment that it is still deferring taking 
action on the matter, and shall make a 
new statement upon the expiration of 
each succeeding one-year period during 
which the committee has not acted on 
the matter. 
(D) The committee may not receive 
any referral from the board of the Of-
fice of Congressional Ethics within 60

public statement by the chair explain-
ing the status of the matter.

the Resident Commissioner is indicted

siders appropriate in the cir-
cumstances.

Hundred Fifth Congress may not be

the committee may at any time so no-
tify the board and request that the 
board cease its review and refer the

eration. If at the end of the applicable 
time period (including any permissible 
extension) the committee has not 
reached a final resolution of the matter 
or has not referred the matter to the 
appropriate Federal or State authori-
ties, the committee shall so notify the 
board of the Office of Congressional 
Ethics in writing. The committee may 
not request the same matter from the 
board more than one time. 
(2) In addition to receiving written 
notifications from the Office of Con-
gressional Ethics under subparagraph 
(1), the committee shall adopt rules 
providing for a process to receive from 
the public outside information offered 
as a complaint. The process shall in-
clude the establishment of a method 
for the submission of such information 
to the committee in electronic form. 
(s) The committee may not take any 
action that would deny any person any 
right or protection provided under the 
Constitution of the United States. 
Audio and visual coverage of committee 
proceedings 
4. (a) The purpose of this clause is to 
provide a means, in conformity with 
acceptable standards of dignity, pro-
priety, and decorum, by which com-
mittee hearings or committee meet-
ings that are open to the public may be 
covered by audio and visual means— 
(1) for the education, enlighten-
ment, and information of the general 
public, on the basis of accurate and 
impartial news coverage, regarding 
the operations, procedures, and prac-
tices of the House as a legislative and 
representative body, and regarding 
the measures, public issues, and 
other matters before the House and 
its committees, the consideration 
thereof, and the action taken there-
on; and 
(2) for the development of the per-
spective and understanding of the 
general public with respect to the 
role and function of the House under 
the Constitution as an institution of 
the Federal Government. 
(b) In addition, it is the intent of this 
clause that audio and video recordings 
of any coverage under this clause may 
not be used for any partisan political

the activities of committee members 
in connection with that hearing or 
meeting or in connection with the 
general work of the committee or of 
the House; or

gitimate space or safety consider-
ations, in which case pool coverage 
shall be authorized). 
(f) Written rules adopted by each

(4) Television cameras shall oper-
ate from fixed positions but may not

ambient lighting level in a hearing or 
meeting room to the lowest level 
necessary to provide adequate tele-
vision coverage of a hearing or meet-
ing at the current state of the art of 
television coverage. 
(7) If requests are made by more of 
the media than will be permitted by

prior application— 
(1) the chair of the Committee on 
the Judiciary shall, in the case of

quest until the last committee author-
ized to consider and report the bill or 
resolution reports it to the House or is 
discharged from its consideration. The

lution. The statement shall appear in a

same right of correction as public 
bills and public resolutions presented 
by Members, Delegates, or the Resi-
dent Commissioner. 
(c) Motions to dispose of Senate 
amendments on the Speaker’s table

sures already favorably reported and

ority of business shall be decided by a

tive days and that proposes a special 
order of business for the consider-
ation of a public bill or public resolu-
tion that has been reported by a com-
mittee or has been referred to a com-
mittee for 30 legislative days. 
(2) Only one motion may be presented 
for a bill or resolution. A Member may 
not file a motion to discharge the Com-
mittee on Rules from consideration of 
a resolution providing for the consider-
ation of more than one public bill or 
public resolution or admitting or ef-
fecting a nongermane amendment to a 
public bill or public resolution. 
(b) A motion presented under para-
graph (a) shall be placed in the custody 
of the Clerk, who shall arrange a con-
venient place for the signatures of 
Members. A signature may be with-
drawn by a Member in writing at any 
time before a motion is entered on the 
Journal. The Clerk shall make the sig-
natories a matter of public record, 
causing the names of the Members who 
have signed a discharge motion during 
a week to be published in a portion of 
the Congressional Record designated 
for that purpose on the last legislative 
day of the week and making cumu-
lative lists of such names available 
each day for public inspection in an ap-
propriate office of the House. The Clerk 
shall devise a means for making such 
lists available to offices of the House 
and to the public in electronic form. 
When a majority of the total member-
ship of the House shall have signed the 
motion, it shall be entered on the Jour-
nal, published with the signatories 
thereto in the Record, and referred to 
the Calendar of Motions to Discharge 
Committees. 
(c)(1) A motion to discharge that has 
been on the calendar for at least seven 
legislative days (except during the last 
six days of a session of Congress) shall 
be privileged only at a time or place, 
designated by the Speaker, in the legis-
lative schedule within two legislative 
days after the day on which a Member 
whose signature appears thereon an-
nounces to the House an intention to 
offer the motion. When such a motion 
is called up, the House shall proceed to 
its consideration under this paragraph 
without intervening motion except one 
motion to adjourn. Privileged motions 
to discharge shall have precedence in 
the order of their entry on the Journal. 
(2) When a motion to discharge is 
called up, the bill or resolution to 
which it relates shall be read by title 
only. The motion is debatable for 20 
minutes, one-half in favor of the mo-
tion and one-half in opposition thereto. 
(d)(1) If a motion prevails to dis-
charge the Committee on Rules from 
consideration of a resolution, the 
House shall immediately consider the 
resolution, pending which the Speaker 
may entertain one motion that the 
House adjourn but may not entertain 
any other dilatory motion until the 
resolution has been disposed of. If the 
resolution is adopted, the House shall 
immediately proceed to its execution. 
(2) If a motion prevails to discharge a 
committee from consideration of a 
public bill or public resolution, a mo-
tion that the House proceed to the im-
mediate consideration of such bill or 
resolution shall be privileged if offered 
by a Member whose signature appeared 
on the motion to discharge. The mo-
tion to proceed is not debatable. If the 
motion to proceed is adopted, the bill 
or resolution shall be considered imme-
diately under the general rules of the 
House. If unfinished before adjourn-
ment of the day on which it is called 
up, the bill or resolution shall remain 
the unfinished business until it is dis-
posed of. If the motion to proceed is re-
jected, the bill or resolution shall be 
referred to the appropriate calendar, 
where it shall have the same status as 
if the committee from which it was dis-
charged had duly reported it to the 
House. 
(e)(1) When a motion to discharge 
originated under this clause has once 
been acted on by the House, it shall not 
be in order to entertain during the 
same session of Congress— 
(A) a motion to discharge a com-
mittee from consideration of that 
bill or resolution or of any other bill 
or resolution that, by relating in sub-
stance to or dealing with the same 
subject matter, is substantially the 
same; or 
(B) a motion to discharge the Com-
mittee on Rules from consideration 
of a resolution providing a special 
order of business for the consider-
ation of that bill or resolution or of 
any other bill or resolution that, by 
relating in substance to or dealing 
with the same subject matter, is sub-
stantially the same. 
(2) A motion to discharge on the Cal-
endar of Motions to Discharge Commit-
tees that is rendered out of order under 
subparagraph (1) shall be stricken from 
that calendar. 
Adverse report by the Committee on 
Rules, second and fourth Mondays

mittee on Rules on a resolution pro-
posing a special order of business for 
the consideration of a public bill or 
public joint resolution may be called

privileged question by a Member, Dele-
gate, or Resident Commissioner on the 
second and fourth Mondays of a month.

(RESERVED.) 
Private Calendar 
5. (a) On the first Tuesday of a 
month, the Speaker shall direct the 
Clerk to call the bills and resolutions 
on the Private Calendar after disposal 
of such business on the Speaker’s table 
as requires reference only. If two or 
more Members, Delegates, or the Resi-
dent Commissioner object to the con-
sideration of a bill or resolution so 
called, it shall be recommitted to the 
committee that reported it. No other 
business shall be in order before com-
pletion of the call of the Private Cal-
endar on this day unless two-thirds of 
the Members voting, a quorum being 
present, agree to a motion that the 
House dispense with the call. 
(b)(1) On any day, after the disposal 
of such business on the Speaker’s table 
as requires reference only, the Speaker 
may direct the Clerk to call any bill or 
resolution that has been on the Private 
Calendar for at least seven days, but 
only on the second legislative day after 
the legislative day on which the Speak-
er or a designee announces to the 
House an intention to do so. Preference 
shall be given to omnibus bills con-
taining the texts of bills or resolutions 
that have previously been objected to 
on a call of the Private Calendar. If 
two or more Members, Delegates, or 
the Resident Commissioner object to 
the consideration of a bill or resolution 
so called (other than an omnibus bill), 
it shall be recommitted to the com-
mittee that reported it. Two-thirds of 
the Members voting, a quorum being 
present, may adopt a motion that the 
House dispense with the call on this 
day. 
(2) Omnibus bills shall be read for 
amendment by paragraph. No amend-
ment shall be in order except to strike 
or to reduce amounts of money or to 
provide limitations. An item or matter 
stricken from an omnibus bill may not 
thereafter during the same session of 
Congress be included in an omnibus 
bill. Upon passage such an omnibus bill 
shall be resolved into the several bills 
and resolutions of which it is com-
posed. The several bills and resolu-
tions, with any amendments adopted 
by the House, shall be engrossed, when 
necessary, and otherwise considered as 
passed severally by the House as dis-
tinct bills and resolutions. 
(c) The Speaker may not entertain a 
reservation of the right to object to the 
consideration of a bill or resolution 
under this clause. A bill or resolution 
considered under this clause shall be 
considered in the House as in the Com-
mittee of the Whole. A motion to dis-
pense with the call of the Private Cal-
endar under this clause shall be privi-
leged. Debate on such a motion shall be 
limited to five minutes in support and 
five minutes in opposition.

completion of the call of those commit-
tees (except as provided by clause 4 of 
rule XIV) whose chair, or other mem-
ber authorized by the committee, has 
announced to the House a request for 
such call at least 72 hours in advance. 
(b) A bill or resolution on either the 
House or the Union Calendar, except 
bills or resolutions that are privileged 
under the Rules of the House, may be 
called under this clause. A bill or reso-
lution called up from the Union Cal-
endar shall be considered in the Com-
mittee of the Whole House on the state 
of the Union without motion, subject 
to clause 3 of rule XVI. General debate 
on a measure considered under this 
clause shall be confined to the measure

read aloud by the Clerk before it is de-
bated. The motion then shall be in the 
possession of the House but may be 
withdrawn at any time before a deci-
sion or amendment thereon. 
Question of consideration 
3. When a motion or proposition is 
entertained, the question, ‘‘Will the 
House now consider it?’’ may not be

stand adjourned to a day and time 
certain. 
(2) Either motion shall be of equal 
privilege with the motion to adjourn 
and shall be decided without debate. 
Divisibility 
5. (a) Except as provided in paragraph 
(b), a question shall be divided on the 
demand of a Member, Delegate, or 
Resident Commissioner before the 
question is put if it includes propo-
sitions so distinct in substance that,

proposition remains. 
(b)(1) A motion or resolution to elect 
members to a standing committee of 
the House, or to a joint standing com-
mittee, is not divisible. 
(2) A resolution or order reported by 
the Committee on Rules providing a

ible. 
(c) A motion to strike and insert is 
not divisible, but rejection of a motion 
to strike does not preclude another mo-
tion to amend. 
Amendments 
6. When an amendable proposition is 
under consideration, a motion to 
amend and a motion to amend that 
amendment shall be in order, and it 
also shall be in order to offer a further 
amendment by way of substitute for 
the original motion to amend, to which 
one amendment may be offered but 
which may not be voted on until the 
original amendment is perfected. An 
amendment may be withdrawn in the 
House at any time before a decision or 
amendment thereon. An amendment to 
the title of a bill or resolution shall 
not be in order until after its passage 
or adoption, shall be in order only if of-
fered by the Majority Leader or a des-
ignee, and shall be decided without de-
bate.

ject different from that under consider-
ation shall be admitted under color of 
amendment.

8. Bills and joint resolutions are sub-
ject to readings as follows: 
(a) A first reading is in full when 
the bill or joint resolution is first 
considered. 
(b) A second reading occurs only 
when the bill or joint resolution is 
read for amendment in a Committee 
of the Whole House on the state of 
the Union under clause 5 of rule 
XVIII. 
(c) A third reading precedes passage 
when the Speaker states the ques-
tion: ‘‘Shall the bill [or joint resolu-
tion] be engrossed [when applicable] 
and read a third time?’’ If that ques-
tion is decided in the affirmative, 
then the bill or joint resolution shall 
be read the final time by title and 
then the question shall be put on its 
passage.

T
HE COMMITTEE OF THE WHOLE HOUSE 
ON THE STATE OF THE UNION 
Resolving into the Committee of the 
Whole 
1. Whenever the House resolves into 
the Committee of the Whole House on 
the state of the Union, the Speaker 
shall leave the chair after appointing a 
Member, Delegate, or the Resident 
Commissioner as Chair to preside. In 
case of disturbance or disorderly con-
duct in the galleries or lobby, the Chair 
may cause the same to be cleared. 
2. (a) Except as provided in paragraph 
(b) and in clause 6 of rule XV, the 
House resolves into the Committee of 
the Whole House on the state of the 
Union by motion. When such a motion 
is entertained, the Speaker shall put 
the question without debate: ‘‘Shall 
the House resolve itself into the Com-
mittee of the Whole House on the state 
of the Union for consideration of this 
matter?’’, naming it. 
(b) After the House has adopted a res-
olution reported by the Committee on 
Rules providing a special order of busi-
ness for the consideration of a measure 
in the Committee of the Whole House 
on the state of the Union, the Speaker 
may at any time, when no question is 
pending before the House, declare the 
House resolved into the Committee of 
the Whole for the consideration of that

vides otherwise.

clause 3 of rule XXII) involving a tax or 
charge on the people, raising revenue, 
directly or indirectly making appro-
priations of money or property or re-
quiring such appropriations to be 
made, authorizing payments out of ap-
propriations already made, or releasing 
any liability to the United States for 
money or property, shall be first con-
sidered in the Committee of the Whole 
House on the state of the Union. A bill, 
resolution, or Senate amendment that 
fails to comply with this clause is sub-
ject to a point of order against its con-
sideration. 
Order of business

business on the calendar of the Com-
mittee of the Whole House on the state

amendment shall be allowed five min-
utes to explain it, after which the 
Member, Delegate, or Resident Com-
missioner who shall first obtain the

same privilege of debate shall be al-
lowed in favor of and against any 
amendment that may be offered to an 
amendment. An amendment, or an 
amendment to an amendment, may be 
withdrawn by its proponent only by the

time that a Committee of the Whole 
finds itself without a quorum during a 
day, the Chair shall invoke the proce-
dure for a quorum call set forth in 
clause 2 of rule XX, unless the Chair 
elects to invoke an alternate procedure 
set forth in clause 3 or clause 4(a) of

mittee of the Whole shall continue its 
business. If a quorum does not appear, 
the Committee of the Whole shall rise, 
and the Chair shall report the names of 
absentees to the House. 
(b)(1) The Chair may refuse to enter-
tain a point of order that a quorum is 
not present during general debate. 
(2) After a quorum has once been es-
tablished on a day, the Chair may en-
tertain a point of order that a quorum 
is not present only when the Com-
mittee of the Whole House on the state 
of the Union is operating under the 
five-minute rule and the Chair has put 
the pending proposition to a vote. 
(3) Upon sustaining a point of order 
that a quorum is not present, the Chair 
may announce that, following a regular 
quorum call under paragraph (a), the 
minimum time for electronic voting on 
the pending question shall be not less 
than two minutes. 
(c) When ordering a quorum call in 
the Committee of the Whole House on 
the state of the Union, the Chair may 
announce an intention to declare that 
a quorum is constituted at any time 
during the quorum call when the Chair 
determines that a quorum has ap-
peared. If the Chair interrupts the 
quorum call by declaring that a 
quorum is constituted, proceedings 
under the quorum call shall be consid-
ered as vacated, and the Committee of 
the Whole shall continue its sitting 
and resume its business. 
(d) A quorum is not required in the 
Committee of the Whole House on the 
state of the Union for adoption of a 
motion that the Committee rise.

missioner. 
(f) In the Committee of the Whole 
House on the state of the Union, the 
Chair may reduce to not less than two 
minutes the minimum time for elec-
tronic voting on any or all pending 
amendments after a record vote has 
been taken on the first pending amend-
ment, if in the discretion of the Chair 
Members, Delegates, and the Resident 
Commissioner would be afforded an 
adequate opportunity to vote. 
(g) The Chair may postpone a request 
for a recorded vote on any amendment. 
The Chair may resume proceedings on 
a postponed request at any time. The 
Chair may reduce to not less than two 
minutes the minimum time for elec-
tronic voting— 
(1) on any postponed question that 
follows another electronic vote, pro-
vided that the minimum time for 
electronic voting on the first in any 
series of questions shall be 15 min-
utes; or 
(2) on any postponed question 
taken after the Committee of the 
Whole resumes its sitting if in the 
discretion of the Chair Members, Del-
egates, and the Resident Commis-
sioner would be afforded an adequate 
opportunity to vote. 
(h) Whenever a recorded vote on any 
question has been decided by a margin 
within which the votes cast by the Del-
egates and the Resident Commissioner 
have been decisive, the Committee of 
the Whole shall rise and the Speaker 
shall put such question de novo with-
out intervening motion. Upon the an-
nouncement of the vote on that ques-
tion, the Committee of the Whole shall 
resume its sitting without intervening 
motion. 
Dispensing with the reading of an 
amendment 
7. It shall be in order in the Com-
mittee of the Whole House on the state 
of the Union to move that the Com-
mittee of the Whole dispense with the 
reading of an amendment that has been 
printed in the bill or resolution as re-
ported by a committee, or an amend-
ment that a Member, Delegate, or Resi-
dent Commissioner has caused to be 
printed in the Congressional Record. 
Such a motion shall be decided without 
debate. 
Closing debate 
8. (a) Subject to paragraph (b) at any 
time after the Committee of the Whole 
House on the state of the Union has 
begun five-minute debate on amend-
ments to any portion of a bill or reso-
lution, it shall be in order to move that 
the Committee of the Whole close all 
debate on that portion of the bill or 
resolution or on the pending amend-
ments only. Such a motion shall be de-
cided without debate. The adoption of 
such a motion does not preclude fur-
ther amendment, to be decided without 
debate. 
(b) If the Committee of the Whole 
House on the state of the Union closes 
debate on any portion of a bill or reso-
lution before there has been debate on 
an amendment that a Member, Dele-
gate, or Resident Commissioner has 
caused to be printed in the Congres-
sional Record at least one day before 
its consideration, the Member, Dele-
gate, or Resident Commissioner who 
caused the amendment to be printed in 
the Record shall be allowed five min-
utes to explain it, after which the 
Member, Delegate, or Resident Com-
missioner who shall first obtain the 
floor shall be allowed five minutes to 
speak in opposition to it. There shall 
be no further debate thereon. 
(c) Material submitted for printing in 
the Congressional Record under this 
clause shall indicate the full text of 
the proposed amendment, the name of 
the Member, Delegate, or Resident 
Commissioner proposing it, the number 
of the bill or resolution to which it will 
be offered, and the point in the bill or 
resolution or amendment thereto 
where the amendment is intended to be 
offered. The amendment shall appear 
in a portion of the Record designated 
for that purpose. Amendments to a 
specified measure submitted for print-
ing in that portion of the Record shall 
be numbered in the order printed. 
Striking the enacting clause 
9. A motion that the Committee of 
the Whole House on the state of the 
Union rise and report a bill or resolu-
tion to the House with the rec-
ommendation that the enacting or re-
solving clause be stricken shall have 
precedence of a motion to amend, and, 
if carried in the House, shall constitute 
a rejection of the bill or resolution. 
Whenever a bill or resolution is re-
ported from the Committee of the 
Whole with such adverse recommenda-
tion and the recommendation is re-
jected by the House, the bill or resolu-
tion shall stand recommitted to the 
Committee of the Whole without fur-
ther action by the House. Before the 
question of concurrence is submitted, 
it shall be in order to move that the 
House refer the bill or resolution to a 
committee, with or without instruc-
tions. If a bill or resolution is so re-
ferred, then when it is again reported 
to the House it shall be referred to the 
Committee of the Whole without de-
bate. 
Concurrent resolution on the budget

debate in the Committee of the Whole 
House on the state of the Union on a 
concurrent resolution on the budget 
under section 305(a) of the Congres-
sional Budget Act of 1974, the concur-
rent resolution shall be considered as 
read for amendment. 
(b) It shall not be in order in the 
House or in the Committee of the 
Whole House on the state of the Union 
to consider an amendment to a concur-
rent resolution on the budget, or an 
amendment thereto, unless the concur-
rent resolution, as amended by such 
amendment or amendments— 
(1) would be mathematically con-
sistent except as limited by para-

(2) would contain all the matter set 
forth in paragraphs (1) through (5) of 
section 301(a) of the Congressional 
Budget Act of 1974.

RULE XIX 
M
OTIONS FOLLOWING THE AMENDMENT 
STAGE 
Previous question 
1. (a) There shall be a motion for the 
previous question, which, being or-
dered, shall have the effect of cutting 
off all debate and bringing the House to 
a direct vote on the immediate ques-
tion or questions on which it has been 
ordered. Whenever the previous ques-
tion has been ordered on an otherwise 
debatable question on which there has 
been no debate, it shall be in order to 
debate that question for 40 minutes, 
equally divided and controlled by a 
proponent of the question and an oppo-
nent. The previous question may be 
moved and ordered on a single ques-
tion, on a series of questions allowable 
under the rules, or on an amendment 
or amendments, or may embrace all 
authorized motions or amendments and 
include the bill or resolution to its pas-
sage, adoption, or rejection. 
(b) Incidental questions of order aris-
ing during the pendency of a motion 
for the previous question shall be de-
cided, whether on appeal or otherwise, 
without debate. 
(c) Notwithstanding paragraph (a), 
when the previous question is oper-
ating to adoption or passage of a meas-
ure pursuant to a special order of busi-
ness, the Chair may postpone further 
consideration of such measure in the 
House to such time as may be des-
ignated by the Speaker. 
Recommit 
2. (a) After the previous question has 
been ordered on passage or adoption of 
a measure, or pending a motion to that 
end, it shall be in order to move that 
the House recommit (or commit, as the 
case may be) the measure, without in-
structions, to a standing or select com-
mittee. For such a motion to recom-
mit, the Speaker shall give preference 
in recognition to a Member, Delegate, 
or Resident Commissioner who is op-
posed to the measure. 
(b) The previous question shall be 
considered as ordered on any motion to 
recommit (or commit, as the case may 
be). 
Reconsideration 
3. When a motion has been carried or 
lost, it shall be in order on the same or 
succeeding day for a Member on the 
prevailing side of the question to enter 
a motion for the reconsideration there-
of. The entry of such a motion shall 
take precedence over all other ques-
tions except the consideration of a con-
ference report or a motion to adjourn, 
and may not be withdrawn after such 
succeeding day without the consent of 
the House. Once entered, a motion may 
be called up for consideration by any 
Member. During the last six days of a 
session of Congress, such a motion 
shall be disposed of when entered. 
4. A bill, petition, memorial, or reso-
lution referred to a committee, or re-
ported therefrom for printing and re-
commitment, may not be brought back 
to the House on a motion to reconsider.

Speaker has put a question to a vote by 
voice as provided in clause 6 of rule I if 
the Speaker is in doubt or division is 
demanded. Those in favor of the ques-
tion shall first rise or otherwise indi-
cate from their seats and be counted, 
and then those opposed. 
(b) If a Member, Delegate, or Resi-
dent Commissioner requests a recorded 
vote, and that request is supported by 
at least one-fifth of a quorum, the vote 
shall be taken by electronic device un-
less the Speaker invokes another pro-
cedure for recording votes provided in 
this rule. A recorded vote taken in the 
House under this paragraph shall be 
considered a vote by the yeas and nays. 
(c) In case of a tie vote, a question 
shall be lost. 
2. (a) Unless the Speaker directs oth-
erwise, the Clerk shall conduct a 
record vote or quorum call by elec-
tronic device. In such a case the Clerk 
shall enter on the Journal and publish 
in the Congressional Record, in alpha-
betical order in each category, the 
names of Members recorded as voting 
in the affirmative, the names of Mem-
bers recorded as voting in the negative, 
and the names of Members answering 
present as if they had been called in 
the manner provided in clause 3. Ex-
cept as otherwise permitted under 
clause 8 or 9 of this rule or under 
clause 6 of rule XVIII, the minimum 
time for a record vote or quorum call 
by electronic device shall be 15 min-
utes. 
(b) When the electronic voting sys-
tem is inoperable or is not used, the 
Speaker or Chair may direct the Clerk 
to conduct a record vote or quorum 
call as provided in clause 3 or 4. 
3. The Speaker may direct the Clerk 
to conduct a record vote or quorum 
call by call of the roll. In such a case 
the Clerk shall call the names of Mem-
bers, alphabetically by surname. When 
two or more have the same surname, 
the name of the State (and, if nec-
essary to distinguish among Members 
from the same State, the given names 
of the Members) shall be added. After 
the roll has been called once, the Clerk 
shall call the names of those not re-
corded, alphabetically by surname. 
Members appearing after the second 
call, but before the result is an-
nounced, may vote or announce a pair. 
4. (a) The Speaker may direct a 
record vote or quorum call to be con-
ducted by tellers. In such a case the 
tellers named by the Speaker shall 
record the names of the Members vot-
ing on each side of the question or 
record their presence, as the case may 
be, which the Clerk shall enter on the 
Journal and publish in the Congres-
sional Record. Absentees shall be 
noted, but the doors may not be closed 
except when ordered by the Speaker. 
The minimum time for a record vote or 
quorum call by tellers shall be 15 min-
utes. 
(b) On the demand of a Member, or at 
the suggestion of the Speaker, the 
names of Members sufficient to make a 
quorum in the Hall of the House who 
do not vote shall be noted by the Clerk, 
entered on the Journal, reported to the 
Speaker with the names of the Mem-
bers voting, and be counted and an-
nounced in determining the presence of 
a quorum to do business. 
5. (a) In the absence of a quorum, a 
majority comprising at least 15 Mem-
bers, which may include the Speaker, 
may compel the attendance of absent 
Members. 
(b) Subject to clause 7(b) a majority 
described in paragraph (a) may order 
the Sergeant-at-Arms to send officers 
appointed by the Sergeant-at-Arms to 
arrest those Members for whom no suf-
ficient excuse is made and shall secure 
and retain their attendance. The House 
shall determine on what condition they 
shall be discharged. Unless the House 
otherwise directs, the Members who 
voluntarily appear shall be admitted 
immediately to the Hall of the House 
and shall report their names to the 
Clerk to be entered on the Journal as 
present. 
(c)(1) If the House should be without 
a quorum due to catastrophic cir-
cumstances, then— 
(A) until there appear in the House 
a sufficient number of Representa-
tives to constitute a quorum among 
the whole number of the House, a 
quorum in the House shall be deter-
mined based upon the provisional 
number of the House; and 
(B) the provisional number of the 
House, as of the close of the call of 
the House described in subparagraph 
(3)(C), shall be the number of Rep-
resentatives responding to that call 
of the House.

termining the provisional number of 
the House thereafter ceases to be a

Rule XX, clause 8 Rule XX, clause 5 
Representative, or if a Representative 
not counted in determining the provi-
sional number of the House thereafter 
appears in the House, the provisional 
number of the House shall be adjusted 
accordingly. 
(3) For the purposes of subparagraph 
(1), the House shall be considered to be 
without a quorum due to catastrophic 
circumstances if, after a motion under 
paragraph (a) has been disposed of and 
without intervening adjournment, each 
of the following occurs in the stated se-
quence: 
(A) A call of the House (or a series 
of calls of the House) is closed after 
aggregating a period in excess of 72 
hours (excluding time the House is in 
recess) without producing a quorum. 
(B) The Speaker— 
(i) with the Majority Leader and 
the Minority Leader (or their re-
spective designees), receives from 
the Sergeant-at-Arms (or a des-
ignee) a catastrophic quorum fail-
ure report, as described in subpara-
graph (4); 
(ii) consults with the Majority 
Leader and the Minority Leader (or 
their respective designees) on the 
content of that report; and 
(iii) announces the content of 
that report to the House. 
(C) A further call of the House (or 
a series of calls of the House) is 
closed after aggregating a period in 
excess of 24 hours (excluding time the 
House is in recess) without producing 
a quorum. 
(4)(A) For purposes of subparagraph 
(3), a catastrophic quorum failure re-
port is a report advising that the in-
ability of the House to establish a 
quorum is attributable to catastrophic 
circumstances involving natural dis-
aster, attack, contagion, or similar ca-
lamity rendering Representatives in-
capable of attending the proceedings of 
the House. 
(B) Such report shall specify the fol-
lowing: 
(i) The number of vacancies in the 
House and the names of former Rep-
resentatives whose seats are vacant. 
(ii) The names of Representatives 
considered incapacitated. 
(iii) The names of Representatives 
not incapacitated but otherwise in-
capable of attending the proceedings 
of the House. 
(iv) The names of Representatives 
unaccounted for. 
(C) Such report shall be prepared on 
the basis of the most authoritative in-
formation available after consultation 
with the Attending Physician to the 
Congress and the Clerk (or their re-
spective designees) and pertinent pub-
lic health and law enforcement offi-
cials. 
(D) Such report shall be updated 
every legislative day for the duration 
of any proceedings under or in reliance 
on this paragraph. The Speaker shall 
make such updates available to the 
House. 
(5) An announcement by the Speaker 
under subparagraph (3)(B)(iii) shall not 
be subject to appeal. 
(6) Subparagraph (1) does not apply 
to a proposal to create a vacancy in the 
representation from any State in re-
spect of a Representative not incapaci-
tated but otherwise incapable of at-
tending the proceedings of the House. 
(7) For purposes of this paragraph: 
(A) The term ‘‘provisional number 
of the House’’ means the number of 
Representatives upon which a 
quorum will be computed in the 
House until Representatives suffi-
cient in number to constitute a 
quorum among the whole number of 
the House appear in the House. 
(B) The term ‘‘whole number of the 
House’’ means the number of Rep-
resentatives chosen, sworn, and liv-
ing whose membership in the House 
has not been terminated by resigna-
tion or by the action of the House. 
(d) Upon the death, resignation, ex-
pulsion, disqualification, removal, or 
swearing of a Member, the whole num-
ber of the House shall be adjusted ac-
cordingly. The Speaker shall announce 
the adjustment to the House. Such an 
announcement shall not be subject to 
appeal. In the case of a death, the 
Speaker may lay before the House such 
documentation from Federal, State, or 
local officials as the Speaker deems 
pertinent. 
6. (a) When a quorum fails to vote on 
a question, a quorum is not present, 
and objection is made for that cause 
(unless the House shall adjourn)— 
(1) there shall be a call of the 
House; 
(2) the Sergeant-at-Arms shall pro-
ceed forthwith to bring in absent 
Members; and 
(3) the yeas and nays on the pend-
ing question shall at the same time 
be considered as ordered. 
(b) The Clerk shall record Members 
by the yeas and nays on the pending 
question, using such procedure as the 
Speaker may invoke under clause 2, 3, 
or 4. Each Member arrested under this 
clause shall be brought by the Ser-
geant-at-Arms before the House, 
whereupon the Member shall be noted 
as present, discharged from arrest, and 
given an opportunity to vote; and such 
vote shall be recorded. If those voting 
on the question and those who are 
present and decline to vote together 
make a majority of the House, the 
Speaker shall declare that a quorum is 
constituted, and the pending question 
shall be decided as the requisite major-
ity of those voting shall have deter-
mined. Thereupon further proceedings 
under the call shall be considered as 
dispensed with. 
(c) At any time after Members have 
had the requisite opportunity to re-
spond by the yeas and nays ordered 
under this clause, but before a result 
has been announced, a motion that the 
House adjourn shall be in order if sec-
onded by a majority of those present, 
to be ascertained by actual count by 
the Speaker. If the House adjourns on 
such a motion, all proceedings under 
this clause shall be considered as va-
cated. 
7. (a) The Speaker may not entertain 
a point of order that a quorum is not 
present unless a question has been put 
to a vote. 
(b) Subject to paragraph (c) the 
Speaker may recognize a Member, Del-
egate, or Resident Commissioner to 
move a call of the House at any time. 
When a quorum is established pursuant 
to a call of the House, further pro-
ceedings under the call shall be consid-
ered as dispensed with unless the 
Speaker recognizes for a motion to 
compel attendance of Members under 
clause 5(b). 
(c) A call of the House shall not be in 
order after the previous question is or-
dered unless the Speaker determines by 
actual count that a quorum is not 
present. 
Postponement of proceedings 
8. (a)(1) When a recorded vote is or-
dered, or the yeas and nays are or-
dered, or a vote is objected to under 
clause 6— 
(A) on any of the questions speci-
fied in subparagraph (2), the Speaker 
may postpone further proceedings to 
a designated place in the legislative 
schedule within two additional legis-
lative days; and 
(B) on the question of agreeing to 
the Speaker’s approval of the Jour-
nal, the Speaker may postpone fur-
ther proceedings to a designated 
place in the legislative schedule on 
that legislative day.

paragraph (1) are as follows: 
(A) The question of passing a bill or 
joint resolution. 
(B) The question of adopting a reso-
lution or concurrent resolution. 
(C) The question of agreeing to a 
motion to instruct managers on the 
part of the House (except that pro-
ceedings may not resume on such a 
motion under clause 7(c) of rule XXII 
if the managers have filed a report in 
the House). 
(D) The question of agreeing to a 
conference report. 
(E) The question of adopting a mo-
tion to recommit. 
(F) The question of adopting a mo-
tion to concur in a Senate amend-
ment, with or without amendment. 
(G) The question of agreeing to an 
amendment. 
(H) The question of ordering the 
previous question on a question de-
scribed in subdivisions (A) through 
(G). 
(I) The question of agreeing to a 
motion to suspend the rules. 
(J) The question of agreeing to a 
motion to reconsider or the question 
of agreeing to a motion to lay on the 
table a motion to reconsider. 
(b) At the time designated by the 
Speaker for further proceedings on 
questions postponed under paragraph 
(a), the Speaker shall resume pro-
ceedings on each postponed question.

Rule XXI, clause 5 Rule XX, clause 8 
(c) If the House adjourns on a legisla-
tive day designated for further pro-
ceedings on questions postponed under 
this clause without disposing of such 
questions, then on the next legislative 
day the unfinished business is the dis-
position of such questions. 
Two-minute votes 
9. (a) The Speaker may reduce to not 
less than two minutes the minimum 
time for electronic voting on any ques-
tion that follows another electronic 
vote or a report from the Committee of 
the Whole, if in the discretion of the 
Speaker Members would be afforded an 
adequate opportunity to vote. 
(b) To the maximum extent prac-
ticable, notice of possible reduced vot-
ing times for a given series of votes 
shall be issued prior to the first elec-
tronic vote in the series. 
Automatic yeas and nays

ered as ordered when the Speaker puts

joint resolution, or on adoption of a 
conference report, making general ap-
propriations or increasing Federal in-
come tax rates (within the meaning of 
clause 5 of rule XXI), or on final adop-
tion of a concurrent resolution on the 
budget or conference report thereon. 
Ballot votes 
11. In a case of ballot for election, a 
majority of the votes shall be nec-
essary to an election. When there is 
not such a majority on the first ballot, 
the process shall be repeated until a 
majority is obtained. In all balloting 
blanks shall be rejected, may not be 
counted in the enumeration of votes, 
and may not be reported by the tellers. 
RULE XXI 
R
ESTRICTIONS ON CERTAIN BILLS 
Reservation of certain points of order 
1. At the time a general appropria-
tion bill is reported, all points of order 
against provisions therein shall be con-
sidered as reserved. 
General appropriation bills and 
amendments 
2. (a)(1) An appropriation may not be 
reported in a general appropriation 
bill, and may not be in order as an 
amendment thereto, for an expenditure 
not previously authorized by law, ex-
cept to continue appropriations for 
public works and objects that are al-
ready in progress. 
(2) A reappropriation of unexpended 
balances of appropriations may not be 
reported in a general appropriation 
bill, and may not be in order as an 
amendment thereto, except to continue 
appropriations for public works and ob-
jects that are already in progress. This 
subparagraph does not apply to trans-
fers of unexpended balances within the 
department or agency for which they 
were originally appropriated that are 
reported by the Committee on Appro-
priations. 
(b) A provision changing existing law 
may not be reported in a general appro-
priation bill, including a provision 
making the availability of funds con-
tingent on the receipt or possession of 
information not required by existing 
law for the period of the appropriation, 
except germane provisions that re-
trench expenditures by the reduction of 
amounts of money covered by the bill 
(which may include those rec-
ommended to the Committee on Appro-
priations by direction of a legislative 
committee having jurisdiction over the 
subject matter) and except rescissions 
of appropriations contained in appro-
priation Acts. 
(c) An amendment to a general ap-
propriation bill shall not be in order if 
changing existing law, including an 
amendment making the availability of 
funds contingent on the receipt or pos-
session of information not required by 
existing law for the period of the ap-
propriation. Except as provided in 
paragraph (d), an amendment pro-
posing a limitation not specifically 
contained or authorized in existing law 
for the period of the limitation shall 
not be in order during consideration of 
a general appropriation bill. 
(d) After a general appropriation bill 
has been read for amendment, a motion 
that the Committee of the Whole 
House on the state of the Union rise 
and report the bill to the House with 
such amendments as may have been 
adopted shall, if offered by the Major-
ity Leader or a designee, have prece-
dence over motions to amend the bill. 
If such a motion to rise and report is 
rejected or not offered, amendments 
proposing limitations not specifically 
contained or authorized in existing law 
for the period of the limitation or pro-
posing germane amendments that re-
trench expenditures by reductions of 
amounts of money covered by the bill 
may be considered. 
(e) A provision other than an appro-
priation designated an emergency 
under section 251(b)(2) or section 252(e) 
of the Balanced Budget and Emergency 
Deficit Control Act, a rescission of 
budget authority, or a reduction in di-
rect spending or an amount for a des-
ignated emergency may not be re-
ported in an appropriation bill or joint 
resolution containing an emergency 
designation under section 251(b)(2) or 
section 252(e) of such Act and may not 
be in order as an amendment thereto. 
(f) During the reading of an appro-
priation bill for amendment in the 
Committee of the Whole House on the 
state of the Union, it shall be in order 
to consider en bloc amendments pro-
posing only to transfer appropriations 
among objects in the bill without in-
creasing the levels of budget authority 
or outlays in the bill. When considered 
en bloc under this paragraph, such 
amendments may amend portions of 
the bill not yet read for amendment 
(following disposition of any points of 
order against such portions) and are 
not subject to a demand for division of 
the question in the House or in the 
Committee of the Whole. 
(g) An amendment to a general ap-
propriation bill shall not be in order if 
proposing a net increase in the level of 
budget authority in the bill. 
3. It shall not be in order to consider 
a general appropriation bill or joint 
resolution, or conference report there-
on, that— 
(a) provides spending authority de-
rived from receipts deposited in the 
Highway Trust Fund (excluding any 
transfers from the General Fund of 
the Treasury); or 
(b) reduces or otherwise limits the 
accruing balances of the Highway 
Trust Fund, 
for any purpose other than for those 
activities authorized for the highway 
or mass transit categories. 
Appropriations on legislative bills 
4. A bill or joint resolution carrying 
an appropriation may not be reported 
by a committee not having jurisdiction 
to report appropriations, and an 
amendment proposing an appropriation 
shall not be in order during the consid-
eration of a bill or joint resolution re-
ported by a committee not having that 
jurisdiction. A point of order against 
an appropriation in such a bill, joint 
resolution, or amendment thereto may 
be raised at any time during pendency 
of that measure for amendment. 
Tax and tariff measures and 
amendments 
5. (a)(1) A bill or joint resolution car-
rying a tax or tariff measure may not 
be reported by a committee not having 
jurisdiction to report tax or tariff 
measures, and an amendment in the 
House or proposed by the Senate car-
rying a tax or tariff measure shall not 
be in order during the consideration of 
a bill or joint resolution reported by a 
committee not having that jurisdic-
tion. A point of order against a tax or 
tariff measure in such a bill, joint reso-
lution, or amendment thereto may be 
raised at any time during pendency of 
that measure for amendment. 
(2) For purposes of subparagraph (1), 
a tax or tariff measure includes an 
amendment proposing a limitation on 
funds in a general appropriation bill for 
the administration of a tax or tariff. 
Passage of tax rate increases 
(b) A bill or joint resolution, amend-
ment, or conference report carrying a 
Federal income tax rate increase may 
not be considered as passed or agreed 
to unless so determined by a vote of 
not less than three-fifths of the Mem-
bers voting, a quorum being present. In 
this paragraph, the term ‘‘Federal in-
come tax rate increase’’ means any 
amendment to subsection (a), (b), (c), 
(d), or (e) of section 1, or to section 
11(b) or 55(b), of the Internal Revenue 
Code of 1986, that imposes a new per-
centage as a rate of tax and thereby in-
creases the amount of tax imposed by 
any such section. 
Consideration of retroactive tax rate 
increases

a bill, joint resolution, amendment, or

ment to subsection (a), (b), (c), (d), or 
(e) of section 1, or to section 11(b) or 
55(b), of the Internal Revenue Code of 
1986, that imposes a new percentage 
as a rate of tax and thereby increases 
the amount of tax imposed by any 
such section; and 
(2) a Federal income tax rate in-
crease is retroactive if it applies to a 
period beginning before the enact-
ment of the provision. 
Designation of public works 
6. It shall not be in order to consider 
a bill, joint resolution, amendment, or 
conference report that provides for the 
designation or redesignation of a public 
work in honor of an individual then 
serving as a Member, Delegate, Resi-
dent Commissioner, or Senator. 
7. It shall not be in order to consider 
a concurrent resolution on the budget, 
or an amendment thereto, or a con-
ference report thereon that contains 
reconciliation directives under section 
310 of the Congressional Budget Act of 
1974 that specify changes in law such 
that the reconciliation legislation re-
ported pursuant to such directives 
would cause an increase in net direct 
spending (as such term is defined in 
clause 10) for the period covered by 
such concurrent resolution. 
8. With respect to measures consid-
ered pursuant to a special order of 
business, points of order under title III 
of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974 
shall operate without regard to wheth-
er the measure concerned has been re-
ported from committee. Such points of 
order shall operate with respect to (as 
the case may be)— 
(a) the form of a measure rec-
ommended by the reporting com-
mittee where the statute uses the 
term ‘‘as reported’’ (in the case of a 
measure that has been so reported); 
(b) the form of the measure made in 
order as an original bill or joint reso-
lution for the purpose of amendment; 
or 
(c) the form of the measure on 
which the previous question is or-
dered directly to passage. 
9. (a) It shall not be in order to con-
sider— 
(1) a bill or joint resolution re-
ported by a committee unless the re-
port includes a list of congressional 
earmarks, limited tax benefits, and 
limited tariff benefits in the bill or in 
the report (and the name of any 
Member, Delegate, or Resident Com-
missioner who submitted a request to 
the committee for each respective 
item included in such list) or a state-
ment that the proposition contains 
no congressional earmarks, limited 
tax benefits, or limited tariff bene-
fits; 
(2) a bill or joint resolution not re-
ported by a committee unless the 
chair of each committee of initial re-
ferral has caused a list of congres-
sional earmarks, limited tax bene-
fits, and limited tariff benefits in the 
bill (and the name of any Member, 
Delegate, or Resident Commissioner 
who submitted a request to the com-
mittee for each respective item in-
cluded in such list) or a statement 
that the proposition contains no con-
gressional earmarks, limited tax ben-
efits, or limited tariff benefits to be 
printed in the Congressional Record 
prior to its consideration; 
(3) an amendment to a bill or joint 
resolution to be offered at the outset 
of its consideration for amendment 
by a member of a committee of ini-
tial referral as designated in a report 
of the Committee on Rules to accom-
pany a resolution prescribing a spe-
cial order of business unless the pro-
ponent has caused a list of congres-
sional earmarks, limited tax bene-
fits, and limited tariff benefits in the 
amendment (and the name of any 
Member, Delegate, or Resident Com-
missioner who submitted a request to 
the proponent for each respective 
item included in such list) or a state-
ment that the proposition contains 
no congressional earmarks, limited 
tax benefits, or limited tariff benefits 
to be printed in the Congressional 
Record prior to its consideration; or 
(4) a conference report to accom-
pany a bill or joint resolution unless 
the joint explanatory statement pre-
pared by the managers on the part of 
the House and the managers on the 
part of the Senate includes a list of 
congressional earmarks, limited tax 
benefits, and limited tariff benefits 
in the conference report or joint 
statement (and the name of any 
Member, Delegate, Resident Commis-
sioner, or Senator who submitted a 
request to the House or Senate com-
mittees of jurisdiction for each re-
spective item included in such list) 
or a statement that the proposition 
contains no congressional earmarks, 
limited tax benefits, or limited tariff 
benefits. 
(b) It shall not be in order to consider 
a conference report to accompany a 
regular general appropriation bill un-
less the joint explanatory statement 
prepared by the managers on the part 
of the House and the managers on the 
part of the Senate includes— 
(1) a list of congressional earmarks, 
limited tax benefits, and limited tar-
iff benefits in the conference report 
or joint statement (and the name of 
any Member, Delegate, Resident 
Commissioner, or Senator who sub-
mitted a request to the House or Sen-
ate committees of jurisdiction for 
each respective item included in such 
list) that were neither committed to 
the conference committee by either 
House nor in a report of a committee 
of either House on such bill or on a 
companion measure; or 
(2) a statement that the propo-
sition contains no such congressional 
earmarks, limited tax benefits, or 
limited tariff benefits. 
(c) It shall not be in order to consider 
a rule or order that waives the applica-
tion of paragraph (a) or (b). As disposi-
tion of a point of order under this para-
graph or paragraph (b), the Chair shall 
put the question of consideration with 
respect to the rule or order or con-
ference report, as applicable. The ques-
tion of consideration shall be debatable 
for 10 minutes by the Member initi-
ating the point of order and for 10 min-
utes by an opponent, but shall other-
wise be decided without intervening 
motion except one that the House ad-
journ. 
(d) In order to be cognizable by the 
Chair, a point of order raised under 
paragraph (a) may be based only on the 
failure of a report, submission to the 
Congressional Record, or joint explana-
tory statement to include a list re-
quired by paragraph (a) or a statement 
that the proposition contains no con-
gressional earmarks, limited tax bene-
fits, or limited tariff benefits. 
(e) For the purpose of this clause, the 
term ‘‘congressional earmark’’ means a 
provision or report language included 
primarily at the request of a Member, 
Delegate, Resident Commissioner, or 
Senator providing, authorizing or rec-
ommending a specific amount of dis-
cretionary budget authority, credit au-
thority, or other spending authority 
for a contract, loan, loan guarantee, 
grant, loan authority, or other expend-
iture with or to an entity, or targeted 
to a specific State, locality or Congres-
sional district, other than through a 
statutory or administrative formula- 
driven or competitive award process. 
(f) For the purpose of this clause, the 
term ‘‘limited tax benefit’’ means— 
(1) any revenue-losing provision 
that— 
(A) provides a Federal tax deduc-
tion, credit, exclusion, or pref-
erence to 10 or fewer beneficiaries 
under the Internal Revenue Code of 
1986, and 
(B) contains eligibility criteria 
that are not uniform in application 
with respect to potential bene-
ficiaries of such provision; or 
(2) any Federal tax provision which

Rule XXII, clause 12 Rule XXII, clause 8 
sional Record or pursuant to clause 3 
of rule XXIX; and 
(B) copies of the report in disagree-
ment and any accompanying state-
ment, together with the text of the 
Senate amendment, have been avail-
able to Members, Delegates, and the 
Resident Commissioner for at least 
two hours. 
(2) Subparagraph (1)(A) does not 
apply during the last six days of a ses-
sion of Congress. 
(3) During consideration of a Senate 
amendment reported in disagreement 
by a conference committee on a gen-
eral appropriation bill, a motion to in-
sist on disagreement to the Senate 
amendment shall be preferential to any 
other motion to dispose of that amend-
ment if the original motion offered by 
the floor manager proposes to change 
existing law and the motion to insist is 
offered before debate on the original 
motion by the chair of the committee 
having jurisdiction of the subject mat-
ter of the amendment or a designee. 
Such a preferential motion shall be 
separately debatable for one hour 
equally divided between its proponent 
and the proponent of the original mo-
tion. The previous question shall be 
considered as ordered on the pref-
erential motion to its adoption without 
intervening motion. 
(c) A conference report or a Senate 
amendment reported in disagreement 
by a conference committee that has 
been available as provided in paragraph 
(a) or (b) shall be considered as read 
when called up. 
(d)(1) Subject to subparagraph (2), the 
time allotted for debate on a con-
ference report or on a motion to dis-
pose of a Senate amendment reported 
in disagreement by a conference com-
mittee shall be equally divided between 
the majority and minority parties. 
(2) If the floor manager for the ma-
jority and the floor manager for the 
minority both support the conference 
report or motion, one-third of the time 
for debate thereon shall be allotted to 
a Member, Delegate, or Resident Com-
missioner who opposes the conference 
report or motion on demand of that 
Member, Delegate, or Resident Com-
missioner. 
(e) Under clause 6(a)(2) of rule XIII, a 
resolution proposing only to waive a 
requirement of this clause concerning 
the availability of reports to Members, 
Delegates, and the Resident Commis-
sioner may be considered by the House 
on the same day it is reported by the 
Committee on Rules. 
9. Whenever a disagreement to an 
amendment has been committed to a 
conference committee, the managers 
on the part of the House may propose a 
substitute that is a germane modifica-
tion of the matter in disagreement. 
The introduction of any language pre-
senting specific additional matter not 
committed to the conference com-
mittee by either House does not con-
stitute a germane modification of the 
matter in disagreement. Moreover, a 
conference report may not include 
matter not committed to the con-
ference committee by either House and 
may not include a modification of spe-
cific matter committed to the con-
ference committee by either or both 
Houses if that modification is beyond 
the scope of that specific matter as 
committed to the conference com-
mittee. 
10. (a)(1) A Member, Delegate, or 
Resident Commissioner may raise a 
point of order against nongermane 
matter, as specified in subparagraph 
(2), before the commencement of de-
bate on— 
(A) a conference report; 
(B) a motion that the House recede 
from its disagreement to a Senate 
amendment reported in disagreement 
by a conference committee and con-
cur therein, with or without amend-
ment; or 
(C) a motion that the House recede 
from its disagreement to a Senate 
amendment on which the stage of 
disagreement has been reached and 
concur therein, with or without 
amendment. 
(2) A point of order against non-
germane matter is one asserting that a 
proposition described in subparagraph 
(1) contains specified matter that 
would violate clause 7 of rule XVI if it 
were offered in the House as an amend-
ment to the underlying measure in the 
form it was passed by the House. 
(b) If a point of order under para-
graph (a) is sustained, a motion that 
the House reject the nongermane mat-
ter identified by the point of order 
shall be privileged. Such a motion is 
debatable for 40 minutes, one-half in 
favor of the motion and one-half in op-
position thereto. 
(c) After disposition of a point of 
order under paragraph (a) or a motion 
to reject under paragraph (b), any fur-
ther points of order under paragraph 
(a) not covered by a previous point of 
order, and any consequent motions to 
reject under paragraph (b), shall be 
likewise disposed of. 
(d)(1) If a motion to reject under 
paragraph (b) is adopted, then after dis-
position of all points of order under 
paragraph (a) and any consequent mo-
tions to reject under paragraph (b), the 
conference report or motion, as the 
case may be, shall be considered as re-
jected and the matter remaining in dis-
agreement shall be disposed of under 
subparagraph (2) or (3), as the case may 
be. 
(2) After the House has adopted one 
or more motions to reject nongermane 
matter contained in a conference re-
port under the preceding provisions of 
this clause— 
(A) if the conference report accom-
panied a House measure amended by 
the Senate, the pending question 
shall be whether the House shall re-
cede and concur in the Senate 
amendment with an amendment con-
sisting of so much of the conference 
report as was not rejected; and 
(B) if the conference report accom-
panied a Senate measure amended by 
the House, the pending question shall 
be whether the House shall insist fur-
ther on the House amendment. 
(3) After the House has adopted one 
or more motions to reject nongermane 
matter contained in a motion that the 
House recede and concur in a Senate 
amendment, with or without amend-
ment, the following motions shall be 
privileged and shall have precedence in 
the order stated: 
(A) A motion that the House recede 
and concur in the Senate amendment 
with an amendment in writing then 
available on the floor. 
(B) A motion that the House insist 
on its disagreement to the Senate 
amendment and request a further 
conference with the Senate. 
(C) A motion that the House insist 
on its disagreement to the Senate 
amendment. 
(e) If, on a division of the question on 
a motion described in paragraph 
(a)(1)(B) or (C), the House agrees to re-
cede, then a Member, Delegate, or Resi-
dent Commissioner may raise a point 
of order against nongermane matter, as 
specified in paragraph (a)(2), before the 
commencement of debate on concur-
ring in the Senate amendment, with or 
without amendment. A point of order 
under this paragraph shall be disposed 
of according to the preceding provi-
sions of this clause in the same manner 
as a point of order under paragraph (a). 
11. It shall not be in order to consider 
a conference report to accompany a 
bill or joint resolution that proposes to 
amend the Internal Revenue Code of 
1986 unless— 
(a) the joint explanatory statement 
of the managers includes a tax com-
plexity analysis prepared by the 
Joint Committee on Taxation in ac-
cordance with section 4022(b) of the 
Internal Revenue Service Restruc-
turing and Reform Act of 1998; or 
(b) the chair of the Committee on 
Ways and Means causes such a tax 
complexity analysis to be printed in 
the Congressional Record before con-
sideration of the conference report. 
12. (a)(1) Subject to subparagraph (2), 
a meeting of each conference com-
mittee shall be open to the public. 
(2) In open session of the House, a 
motion that managers on the part of 
the House be permitted to close to the 
public a meeting or meetings of their 
conference committee shall be privi-
leged, shall be decided without debate, 
and shall be decided by the yeas and 
nays. 
(3) In conducting conferences with 
the Senate, managers on the part of 
the House should endeavor to ensure— 
(A) that meetings for the resolu-
tion of differences between the two 
Houses occur only under cir-
cumstances in which every manager 
on the part of the House has notice of 
the meeting and a reasonable oppor-
tunity to attend; 
(B) that all provisions on which the 
two Houses disagree are considered 
as open to discussion at any meeting 
of a conference committee; and

ment. 
(4) Managers on the part of the House 
shall be provided a unitary time and 
place with access to at least one com-
plete copy of the final conference 
agreement for the purpose of recording 
their approval (or not) of the final con-
ference agreement by placing their sig-
natures (or not) on the sheets prepared 
to accompany the conference report 
and joint explanatory statement of the 
managers. 
(b) A point of order that a conference 
committee failed to comply with para-
graph (a) may be raised immediately 
after the conference report is read or 
considered as read. If such a point of 
order is sustained, the conference re-
port shall be considered as rejected, the 
House shall be considered to have in-
sisted on its amendments or on dis-
agreement to the Senate amendments, 
as the case may be, and to have re-
quested a further conference with the 
Senate, and the Speaker may appoint 
new conferees without intervening mo-
tion. 
13. It shall not be in order to consider 
a conference report the text of which 
differs in any way, other than clerical, 
from the text that reflects the action 
of the conferees on all of the dif-
ferences between the two Houses, as re-
corded by their placement of their sig-
natures (or not) on the sheets prepared 
to accompany the conference report 
and joint explanatory statement of the 
managers.

sioner, officer, or employee of the

Commissioner, officer, or employee, 
shall be considered a gift to the Mem-
ber, Delegate, Resident Commissioner, 
officer, or employee if it is given with 
the knowledge and acquiescence of the 
Member, Delegate, Resident Commis-
sioner, officer, or employee and the 
Member, Delegate, Resident Commis-
sioner, officer, or employee has reason 
to believe the gift was given because of 
the official position of such individual.

at the same time and place to both a

friendship unless the Member, Dele-
gate, Resident Commissioner, officer, 
or employee of the House has reason 
to believe that, under the cir-
cumstances, the gift was provided be-
cause of the official position of such 
individual and not because of the per-
sonal friendship. 
(ii) In determining whether a gift is 
provided on the basis of personal 
friendship, the Member, Delegate, 
Resident Commissioner, officer, or 
employee of the House shall consider 
the circumstances under which the

of such individual with the indi-
vidual giving the gift, including

tween them.
