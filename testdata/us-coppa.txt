(b) The Congress finds that the World Wide Web presents special dangers for the collection of personal information from children.

(c) Children are particularly vulnerable to exploitation and harm from online threats, as they may not understand the privacy implications of their online activities and may not have the maturity to provide meaningful consent.

(d) The protection of the privacy of children is a matter of national concern as technological threats to children's privacy grow more sophisticated and pervasive.

Section 15.6502
Purpose

(a) It is the purpose of this title to require operators of websites or online services directed to children or that knowingly collect personal information from children to obtain verifiable parental consent before collecting, using, or disclosing such information.

(b) It is the purpose of this title to prohibit conditioning a child's participation in a game, the offering of a prize, or another activity on the child disclosing more personal information than is reasonably necessary to participate in such activity.

(c) It is the purpose of this title to require operators to establish and maintain reasonable procedures to protect the confidentiality, security, and integrity of personal information collected from children.

Section 15.6503
Definitions

For purposes of this title:

(a) 'child' means an individual under the age of 13.

(d) 'verifiable parental consent' means any reasonable effort, taking into consideration available technology, including a request for authorization for future collection, use, and disclosure described in the notice, to ensure that a parent of a child receives notice of the operator's personal information collection, use, and disclosure practices, and authorizes the collection, use, and disclosure, as applicable, of personal information and the subsequent use of that information before that information is collected from that child.

CHAPTER 2
Operator Requirements

Article 3
Collection and Use Requirements

Section 15.6504
Requirements for operators

(a) It shall be unlawful for an operator of a website or online service directed to children, or any operator that has actual knowledge that it is collecting personal information from a child, to collect personal information from a child in a manner that violates the regulations prescribed under this title.

(b) The Commission shall promulgate regulations that require the operator of any website or online service directed to children that collects personal information from children or the operator of a website or online service that has actual knowledge that it is collecting personal information from a child to provide notice on the website of what information is collected from children by the operator, how the operator uses such information, and the operator's disclosure practices for such information.

(c) The regulations shall require operators to obtain verifiable parental consent for the collection, use, or disclosure of personal information from children. This requirement is consistent with the protections established under Regulation (EU) 2016/679 for the processing of children's personal data.

(d) The regulations shall require the operator to provide, upon request of a parent whose child has provided personal information to that website or online service, upon proper identification of that parent, a description of the specific types of personal information collected from the child by that operator.

(e) The regulations shall provide that the parent has the opportunity at any time to refuse to permit the operator's further use or maintenance in retrievable form, or future online collection, of personal information from that child.

(f) The regulations shall require the operator of such a website or online service to establish and maintain reasonable procedures to protect the confidentiality, security, and integrity of personal information collected from children. This obligation is similar to the security requirements imposed under Section 1798.150 of the California Consumer Privacy Act.

Section 15.6505
Prohibition on disclosure to third parties

(a) Personal information collected from children shall not be disclosed to third parties unless the operator has obtained verifiable parental consent.
